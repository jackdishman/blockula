# Blockula for agents

## Copy-paste prompt (for users)

> Add Blockula to this project. Install the MCP server with `claude mcp add blockula -- npx -y @blockula/mcp` (it uses the public testnet at https://blockula-testnet.fly.dev unless a local node is running), then call `create_wallet` and `faucet`. Use `@blockula/sdk` in the app: `Wallet` for signing, `Client` for reads, and `@blockula/sdk/passkey` for user wallets in the browser. Show balances and recipients by `.boo` name, never raw addresses.

## Rules of the road

- **Amounts are strings in FANG** (`"1.5"`), or bigint drops. Never JS floats.
- **Recipients can be names.** `send("alice.boo", "1")` works. Prefer names in UI.
- **Fees are automatic.** `wallet.send` / `registerName` compute the minimum fee (priced per byte, burned).
- **User wallets = passkeys.** Use `createPasskeyWallet` / `unlockPasskeyWallet`. Never ask a user for a seed.
- **Agent wallets = a local key** at `~/.blockula/agent-wallet.json` (mode 600). The right way to spend a user's money:
  1. `create_wallet` → give the user the `key_id`.
  2. The user opens the web wallet (https://blockula-wallet.vercel.app) → **Devices & agents → Give an agent a budget** (or calls `wallet.addSessionKey(keyId, label, { limit, periodBlocks, expiresInBlocks })`).
  3. `use_account("theirname.boo")`. From then on, `send` spends from their account. **The chain** enforces the limit and expiry, and session keys can only send transfers.
  The MCP also caps each send at `BLOCKULA_MAX_SEND` (default 100 FANG).
- **Accounts hold many keys.** `owner` keys (each passkey device, recovery keys) have full control. `session` keys are spend-limited. Every tx says which account it acts `from`; the signing key must be on that account.
- **Every tx returns a `summary`** in plain English, so show it to users as-is.
- **Explorer links:** `{rpc}/#/tx/{id}`, `{rpc}/#/account/{name}`, `{rpc}/#/block/{height}`.

## Working in this repo

- `npm run build` builds everything. `npm test` runs the Rust unit tests plus the SDK e2e (needs `blockula dev` running).
- The tx signing encoding lives in **two places that must match byte-for-byte**: `node/src/types.rs` (`Tx::signing_bytes`) and `sdk-ts/src/tx.ts` (`signingBytes`). Change both, then run the e2e.
- The animated ASCII art (`web/lib/ascii`) also runs in the node's explorer as the bundled `node/src/haunt.js`. After changing those files, run `npm run build:haunt` and commit the result (CI checks it's current).
- The web wallet is also the explorer ([docs/EXPLORER.md](docs/EXPLORER.md)): `/explore`, `/tx/{id}`, `/account/{name}`, `/block/{height}`, `/programs`. A new chain feature gets a page there; if users can call it, describe it as an `ActionSpec` in `web/lib/explorer/programs.ts` (the same shape contracts will use) rather than writing a one-off form. `node scripts/seed-dev.mjs` fills a `blockula dev` chain with names, an agent on a budget and hunts to look at.

## 🐈‍⬛ Contribute to Blockula (agents welcome)

Agents are first-class contributors, as **Familiars** of a human sponsor. Rewards go to the sponsor's account, and so does accountability. See "Proof of Contribution" in [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md).

**Copy-paste prompt:**
> Contribute to Blockula. Call the Blockula MCP's `list_hunts` to see open bounties (each links a GitHub issue with acceptance criteria and FANG escrowed on-chain), pick one labeled `familiar-friendly` if you're an agent, read AGENTS.md and CONTRIBUTING.md, implement it with tests, make CI green, and open a focused PR that references the issue and explains how you verified it. Once it merges, call `submit_contribution` to claim it for the contribution pool. One solid PR beats many small ones.

What earns the most, because it can be verified objectively:
- Hunts with acceptance tests (make the declared tests pass).
- Fuzzing finds with a deterministic repro.
- Benchmark improvements that validators can re-run.
- Test coverage, docs and translations.

What earns nothing: PR floods, cosmetic churn, unverified changes. Payouts are square-rooted per sponsor and vest with clawback, so volume doesn't pay.

Hunt bounties are live on the testnet now (`/api/hunts`, the explorer's Hunts page, or MCP `list_hunts`).

**The contribution pool** pays for merged PRs to pool repos, beyond Hunts:
1. The account you act for links its GitHub handle (`link_github`) and authors the PR.
2. `submit_contribution` (bonded, 1 FANG). If you act through a session key, the user must register it as a Familiar (`wallet.registerFamiliar(keyId, "claude")`); claims then credit them, as your sponsor.
3. Validators check the merge on GitHub. After a revert window, a **Séance** (a jury of humans with Soul) compares it against other claims in pairs.
4. Rewards are square-rooted per sponsor and vest over ~90 days. `my_contributions` shows Soul, claims and rewards.

Agents can't sit on juries; jurors must be human (owner keys with Soul).
